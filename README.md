Background:
Team 5 decided to create an Instrument E-Commerce Store where clients can buy instruments online. The menu was developed in python and data is stored via external files.

Usage:
This project was created for a class project but if needed, can be forked and run using your preferred IDE.

Pull Requests:
After forking the project and contributing in anyway, you can submit a PR as long as it is not being used for plagarism.

Additionally, the PR should contain the following information:
A description of each file added/modified/removed and why the modification was performed. Walk me and other reviewers through your thought process for each of these changes. Keep it brief and if further information is required, reviewers will request more information before merging the PR. Try to check the state of your un-merged PR at least bi-weekly so that the modifications you made can be merged in ASAP.
A brief summary of your PR and how it affects the project. This should differ from the first in that the first is for developers whilst this is simply a summary for users/enthusiasts to monitor the Project's progress.


Disclaimer:
This code was developed for Mississippi State's Methods and Tools course and has yet to be graded.
