Background:
Team 5 decided to create an Instrument E-Commerce Store where clients can buy instruments online. The menu was developed in python and data is stored via external files.

Usage:
This project was created for a class project but if needed, can be forked and run using your preferred IDE.

Disclaimer:
This code was developed for Mississippi State's Methods and Tools course and has yet to be graded.
